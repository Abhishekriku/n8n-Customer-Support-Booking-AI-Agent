# Customer Support & Booking AI Agent (n8n + OpenAI + Notion/Sheets)

### Problem
Handling customer queries and bookings manually is time-consuming and inconsistent. Customers expect instant replies and smooth booking experiences.

### Solution (n8n Workflow)
This workflow automates customer support and booking by:
- **Chat Input**: Accepts customer queries via WhatsApp/Telegram/Email.
- **AI Classification**: OpenAI node understands intent (FAQ vs Booking).
- **Booking Flow**: Collects details (date, service, customer info).
- **Database Logging**: Stores booking info in Notion/Google Sheets.
- **Escalation**: Routes complex issues to a human agent if confidence is low.

### Result
- Faster response times (instant FAQ replies).
- Automated booking confirmations.
- Seamless escalation for unresolved queries.

### Stack
- **n8n** (automation workflow)
- **OpenAI Chat Model** (intent classification, responses)
- **WhatsApp/Telegram/Email** (customer input)
